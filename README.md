# RubiksCubeSolver

This is a program I am developing that automatically solve a Rubiks cube. It currently contains all the most important functionality needed to model and change the cube through rotations.
The plan is to use the base class to implement a variety of Rubiks cube solving techniques, with the first ones being the Thistlewaite algorithm and the more generic beginner algorithms.

Also in the works is a graphical user interface to visualize the cube and allow users to input their own cube states which the program can then solve.
